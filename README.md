# Pull Request Guidelines

These guidelines make the review process easier, so try to use it :)

## Title Format
- For new features, use: `Feat: [Feature Name]`
- For bug fixes, use: `Fix: [Bug Description]`
- For code refactoring (improvement of code that was already there): `Refactor: [Part of Code or Component]`

## Description
- Write a small description of the changes implemented in the PR, if the title is not clear enough:
  - Include what behavior you expect from your changes / how its supposed to look like.
  - Add a screenshot if it's a UI change.

## Before Submitting
- Ensure your branch is up to date by **rebasing** or **merging** the latest changes.
